System: Bulk silicon with its primitive cell repeated twice in the direction of the first axis (2x1x1 supercell).
To be noticed that the code finds 4 7 7 instead of the "expected" 4 8 8 considering the convergence study of the primitive cell (available in the silicon/ directory). This is due to the fact that the code explores different k-point point grids for the supercell and the primitive cell. For example, the converged supercell grid 4 7 7 corresponds to 8 7 7 in the primitive cell, which the code would never consider for an isotropic system.
